# Deep Regression via Multi-Channel Multi-Modal Learning for Pneumonia Screening
Source code for the paper [Deep Regression via Multi-Channel Multi-Modal Learning for Pneumonia Screening](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9078812)

We use and modify some code from project: https://github.com/DeepRNN/image_captioning.  

Before using this code, please download pre-trained weights (ResNet-50, VGG16, GoogleNet-V3) from the link below:

Passcode :su33  

The trained weights for the proposed framework is listed in 'models'  
The trained word2vec for the textual information is listed in '/txt/ltp/'
